The Researcher described how the test works, asked the Participant to think out loud, and got verbal permission to record their screen and voice. The Researcher asked the Participant to close any windows that they didn’t want to be seen and then passed presenter control to the Participant.

              Unsurprisingly, we found a lot of usability issues. Many of them were with specific tools but there were a quite number of issues with just navigating the system. We decided they were a higher priority because they were universal issues and not tool specific or role based (i.e. instructor).

            The next step is important. You need to both; explain the issues, and provide possible solutions. It’s important to generate awareness and excitement about the issues. It’s also vital to tailor you message to your audience. If this is your organization first time doing usability testings;  you need to guide them through the user experience process. 

            Present solutions this is really what designer is — a problem solver

             Yes, in some ways these are bandaids?

             A bandaid is an inelegant design solution. But as a parent of a toddler I know that it helps to acknowledge that there is a booboo.  

             It’s better than doing nothing and in many cases this may be all you can do.

             I was lucky in so far as I could go beyond quick fixes. I was able to start over to build the user interface from scratch. In the initial skinning and when I added some quick fixes I knew that there were a lot of issues with the Sakai User Interface codebase. I was very unhappy with how the CSS was organized. It was confusing, full of hacks that were no longer needed, and difficult to override. I thought we really to create a new foundational user interface and build off of that. We need a new system that took advantage of modern web development technologies especially a CSS preprocessor.

             In the past, when we designed web pages, we usually started by converting Photoshop mockups to HTML and CSS. We would start in the top left corner and work down the page. We may start with the homepage design or if we were more adventurous we’d start with an interior content page. This pattern is often referred to as designing from the outside in. 

             This worked fairly well with simple static sites. There were only a few templates to worry about. But with more complex content management system this pattern started to be less useful. Often there were pages or variations of pages that were not captured by the initial mockups. The markup was sufficiently different and our styles were too closely coupled that it started to break. We ended up with a lot of half styled pages. In more dynamic system components may be on a page based on context. We can’t always know what’s forsee what's going to be on every page. 

             We now realize that we need to design web systems and not web pages. We need to design from the inside out not the outside in. Design the small discrete chunks of functionality that comprise parts of our sites. In such a way they can be on any part of  our site and not tied to one location on a particular page.

             One common pattern is to design using a component based style guide first and worry about layout at a later stage. This makes even more sense in the age of responsive of design. We no longer have an authoritative layout. Elements will shift, grow and shrink, depending on their context. We can no longer design under the mass delusion of a canonical screen size; be it 960, or 800 x 600 before it. 
   
             This gives developers a freedom to do what they do best and not worry about design decisions. If a developer his creating the User Interface then someone has not thought this project through.

             Don’t get me wrong, developers make design decisions everyday, when it comes to code. But they shouldn’t have to make interface or interactions design decisions. I’ll always welcome input and ideas from every member of the team. I love working with developers who think about the users interaction, I seek them out, but I don’t expect them to be responsible for these kinds of decisions. Alan Cooper discussed this at length in _Inmates Are Running the Asylum_ back in 1999. 

             With style guide driven development we can divided our design into reusable components or modules. As far as designing the User Interface. I am using a CSS preprocessor, SASS in this case, so I can break the styles into discrete files that do just one thing.

             Naming things is hard. Organizing a UI system is hard too. Rather than reinvent the wheel I looked at what others were doing and chose the one that made most sense to me and the projects’ needs.

              Sass while powerful can be misused. You can create brittle, inflexible, and unmaintainable CSS with Sass as with vanilla CSS. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

            It doesn’t matter what system you use but that you use a system. What you want to create is a consistent system that is approachable to others. The goal is to empower developers where they aren’t forced to just add counter styles to the both of your stylesheet.

            How I got more involved in the Sakai community was by getting my code reviewed by the open source community — as part of getting the new UI out to NYU — at the end of the review session I was asked to commit this back to the project. I had mentioned that in order to get the design to be responsive we would need new templates. The current ones were brittle and hard to work with. The markup had a lot of cruft that built up over the years and it made the most sense to start over.

            We decided to create new HTML 5 templates that could be optionally enabled. The new version of the software was going to be released. Long before the coding could be completed. For political and philosophical reasons. They did not want to release new features halfway during the product cycle: They wanted it to go into a major cycle (_10.0_) and not a ’dot’ release (_10.1_, or _10.x_).

            It took an additional year to get the new User Interface into production. As the original deadline approached and QA work was well underway. The plug was pulled on adding the new UI to the project. The pilot had been a success. The full migration was underway and within in 3 months of the project‘s final deadline. The heads of the project were nervous and were afraid of changing things at the last minute. The wanted to tie a neat bow on the project and throw the wrap party. 
            
            This to say the least was difficult for me. I had put a lot of work into the new UI and really believe it was going to be helpful and solve problems that I knew our users faced. Fortunately, I had taken a UX leadership course with Kim Goodwin. I knew that change is not easy and doesn’t happen overnight. Kim stated that it can take 3-5 years to get an organization to change. but that it’s takes a long time but it’s vital to get one project out there that can be an example to others of how UX works. I knew I had to persevere and no take no for an answer. Kim had talk a lot about culture and how this was a vital part of change. The university was a clan like structure. Lots of little groups that want to have their say and need to be listened too.   
            
            It took about a month to get an outline of the concerns that the project leads had. They were wary of changing things and upsetting the users. They outlined a number of steps that needed to be done for them to see this project through. 

            I suggested that we follow the example of Google and Facebook and have a opt-in design preview. An ability to toggle between the new and the old interface. Allowing users to look at the new design in a time of their choosing and allowing them to submit feedback.

            At times, I felt like a salesman demoing the same dog and pony show over and over again.   But each demo was an opportunity to make the UI better. Discussing the new user interface with these groups allowed for thoughtful discussion and feedback. Some great ideas were generated and added to the UI by these meetings. It also allowed me to build support and an informal coalition for getting this work out. Preflight usability testing  helped greatly test and confirm design hypotheses. We did some A/B testing of the new vs the old interface. We were able to recruit some faculty who had never seen the interface  and get them to try the same tasks in both.

            We also added some code so we could find out who tried the new UI and whether or not they had it turned on or not. This allowed us to get an idea of who brought the new UI for a test drive and to know whether or not they stuck with it. It also allowed us a way to contact the users of the new UI if we needed to.

              Next time you’re tasked to add institutional branding to a website. I ask you to try some usability testing first. It may be the most eye opening morning you’ll have. For me now usability testing is an essential part of design. I’ll avoid designing a user interface without planning on doing usability testing. Preferably before, during, and after the design.
